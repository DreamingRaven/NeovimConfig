# NeovimConfig
My current Neovim setup (separate from other config files so you can pick and choose)

sh install.sh or chmod it to install the files in the default Neovim location. copy.sh copies them back in, should you wish to make a fork and use your own copy.

Please see https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug if you have not already installed vim-plug or uncomment the vim-plug section in install.sh
